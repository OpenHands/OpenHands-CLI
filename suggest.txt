PR Title:
Add external editor support with CTRL+X shortcut

PR Description:
Adds external editor support to OpenHands CLI with CTRL+X keyboard shortcut.

## New Feature
Users can now press **CTRL+X** to open their preferred external editor for composing longer messages or complex input.

## How it works
- Press CTRL+X while in the input field
- Opens the editor defined by $VISUAL or $EDITOR environment variables
- Falls back to common editors (nano, vim, code) if env vars not set
- Content is loaded into the editor, user edits and saves
- Content is loaded back into the input field when editor closes
- User must press Enter/Ctrl+Enter to submit the edited content
- Works in both single-line and multi-line input modes

## UI Updates
- Status line now shows "Ctrl+L for multi-line • Ctrl+X for custom editor"
- Clear indication of available shortcuts next to the input field
- Notification messages when editor opens/closes

## Implementation Details
- Uses CTRL+X to avoid conflicts with Textual's built-in key bindings
- Suspends the TUI while editor is open for clean experience
- Handles editor errors gracefully with user notifications
- Temporary files are properly cleaned up after use

## Testing
- All tests pass (285/285)
- Comprehensive test coverage for status line updates
- Linting and type checking clean

This feature enables power users to leverage their preferred editor for complex input while maintaining the streamlined TUI experience.
