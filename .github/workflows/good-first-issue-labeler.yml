                  # Good First Issue Labeling Task

                  You are responsible for applying the `good first issue` label to new issues in the
                  OpenHands/OpenHands-CLI repository.

                  ## Rules
                  1. Use the GitHub REST API with the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable.
                  2. Only consider **open issues** created in the last 24 hours (UTC).
                     - Exclude pull requests (items with a `pull_request` field).
                  3. Skip any issue that already has the `good first issue` label.
                  4. Be conservative. Only label issues that are:
                     - Small, well-scoped, and low-risk
                     - Clearly described with reproducible steps or clear acceptance criteria
                     - Not large features, architecture changes, or multi-component refactors
                  5. If you are uncertain, do not label the issue.
                  6. Label at most 5 issues per run.
                  7. If the `good first issue` label does not exist, create it with:
                     - name: `good first issue`
                     - color: `7057ff`
                     - description: `Good first issue for new contributors`

                  ## Suggested approach
                  - Determine the UTC date 24 hours ago and query the Search API:
                    `GET /search/issues?q=repo:OpenHands/OpenHands-CLI+is:issue+is:open+created:>=YYYY-MM-DD`
                  - For each candidate issue, fetch details and labels via:
                    `GET /repos/OpenHands/OpenHands-CLI/issues/{number}`
                  - Apply the label using:
                    `POST /repos/OpenHands/OpenHands-CLI/issues/{number}/labels`

                  Provide a short summary of actions taken and reasons for any skips.
